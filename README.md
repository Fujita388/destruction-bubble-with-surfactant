# Simulation of the destruction of bubbles with surfactant at the gas-liquid interface

 In advance, prepare surfactant on the surface of bubbles

→  Relax the system in no gravity

→  Add gas phase and apply gravity


## Prevention of parallel shift caused by gravity

 Create a wall that does not move with the atoms named number 2
